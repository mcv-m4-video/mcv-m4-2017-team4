# mcv-m4-2017-team4

To execute the differents task realized in this week 5:

    Task 1.1 can be found in m4_week5_task1.m, there are there variable which could be modify. Params contains all the parameters for use the 
	functions of other weeks it also include the variable to computed the speed: fps for the frame rate of the video, km which is the conversion 
	between kilometers/h and meters/s and last pixel which the relation between a pixel in hte homografy and the distance. In all the code there
	are other parameters hardcode. The parameter pixel is estimated as the aprameter reference, which is the referent points for the homografy, 
	so this recomended to change this parameters.
	
	Task 1.2 can be found in m4_week5_task1b.m, it follows the same scheme as the Task 1.1 for the parameters.

	Task 2,3,4 all of them are already implemented in the files of the previous task. Task 2 and task 3 are always enable and a message in the 
	terminal at the end of the execution, showing the results. For Task 4 there are the lines commented for each dataset, only selecting the ones 
	for the own dataste will make the program work with these images.
